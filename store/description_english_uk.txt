With the HW-Manager you can make your schoolday easier and keep the overview over your homework.
The target of the project is to keep it easy to manage your homework and do not be bloated like some other apps.

Future Features:
- Notifications
- Edit homework
- Import/export homework
- Sort display
- Add own subjects

The App is open source, so that you can take part, even if you are not a programmer.
